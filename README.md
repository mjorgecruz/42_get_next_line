# 42_get_next_line

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.</br></br>
It is the first project from the [Common Core curriculum](https://42.fr/en/the-program/software-engineer-degree/) at 42 where memory leaks are an issue, and it is, therefore, a major leap into the basics of C programming.

## How to use

1. Clone repository
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mjorgecruz/42_get_next_line.git
    ```
